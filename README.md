# HPCA Assignment
Optimize diagonal matrix multiplication using hardware counters.
Contained are two folders:
* PartA: Contains setup for single-threaded and multi-threaded program.
* PartB: Contains setup for GPU program.

Each folder contains two sub-folders, a Makefile, and a main program.
* Makefile: Contains commands necessary to compile, generate inputs, and run the program.
* data folder: Contains program that generates input, and will contain input once generated.
* header folder: Files containing the function that performs the operation. Modify the files in this folder.
* main.cpp: Program that takes inputs and executes the functions. DO NOT MODIFY THIS.

Navigate to each folder to begin setting up the system.
Inside each folder do the following:
### Compiling and generating input
```
make
```
### Running program
```
make run
```
